Hi! My name is Anastasia Razdaibiedina.
<br/>
<br/>

I am a Computational Biology Ph.D. student at University of Toronto and a postgraduate affiliate at Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. After receiving my B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, I entered Ph.D. program to pursue research at the intersection of computer vision and biomedical imaging.

<br/>
<br/>
I am excited about semi-supervised learning, representation learning and deep learning. I am also interested in application of machine learning methods in biomedical research, in particular learning features from large-scale microscopy datasets for protein function prediction and GAN-based image restoration.

<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, comments or ideas, feel free to email me at firstname.lastname at mail.utoronto.ca. I am happy to hear from you.
