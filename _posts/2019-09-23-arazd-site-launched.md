Hello, world! I'm launching my blog today. In my posts I will mostly give tutorials about interesting <u>algorithms</u> and <u>concepts</u> from *machine learning*, *statistics* and *linear algebra* and also write about useful coding tricks. Hope you will enjoy my writings.

See you again in my future posts ;)
